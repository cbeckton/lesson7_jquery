### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (jQuery is a Javascript library that simplifies code due to having the ability to call for specific actions to occur that are already stored as commands in the library. There are many features compacted into this library and they can also be easily altered if necessary. )
2. (jQuery has simplified Javascript for coders. This is useful because often times coders are reusing code that has already been written, and with jQuery, Javascript code is saved and easily reusable in other projects.)
3. (You add Javascript to your HTML code using <script></script> and referencing the source of the script within the first set of arrows(< >). You place this code in your HTML file before the closing body tag.)
